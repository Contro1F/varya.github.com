I am a front-end developer originally from the Utmost North
([Petrozavodsk](http://maps.yandex.com/-/CVR3nIPf),
Karelia); currently living in
[Moscow](http://images.yandex.com/yandsearch?text=Moscow), Russia and working for
[Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/).<br/>
The name from official papers is `Varvara Stepanova`, although everyone calls me
by my homename `Varya`.

I has been working with [BEM](http://bem.info/) team for almost 4 years. BEM is
a project of pushing a full stack of technologies behind Yandex in-house UI framework into open
source.<br/>
Besides developing BEM technologies, libraries and tools, I am a frequent
speaker on BEM at local and international conferences. Also I write articles,
tutorials and training projects to help developers with understanding and diving
into BEM. You can find it all on the [content](en/content/) page.

I am keen on traveling and dream to have friends all over the world. The last
important thing you should know — I am passionate about cats, all of them, no
matter lion or kitten.

In this site I am going to publish my day-to-day writings as well as links to
further articles, projects and presentations.

This site is available in both English and [Russian](/ru).

LOVE</a> project to demonstrate how blocks
can communicate with JavaScript.<excerpt/></p>
<p>The first example is dull enough; <a href="http://toivonen.github.com/bem-love/desktop.bundles/ask-her-what-music-she-likes/ask-her-what-music-she-likes.html">a boy, a girl and the heartless
world</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I was going to start with another one with a boy plunging into
difficulties of choice. He has <a href="http://toivonen.github.com/bem-love/desktop.bundles/choose-the-one/choose-the-one.html">two girls to
ask</a>.
Suddenly there is a <strong>challenge for you</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s think if it’s possible to attract a boy with a booooooring one-colour
dress? Seems like no.<br/>
So, the girls in the page are in need of nice patterned dresses. Any ideas on
how to code a patterned triangle in CSS?</p>
<h3 id="where-to-code-">Where to code?</h3>
<p>To dress the girls excellenty and toppingly you need just three steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project and <a href="https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love#how-to-contribute">run the
server</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love/tree/master/desktop.bundles/choose-the-one/blocks/girl/_dressed">Contribute to modifiers</a></li>
<li>Make your pull request</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrozavodsk">Petrozavodsk</a> (Petroskoi in Finnish). Trips to there are quite a challenge
as the trasport connection is not the best. Apparently the go-by-car option turned out to be the most comfortable. I
recommend all my Finnish friends to have such a trip, at least once in a lifetime. You will see the Russian region which
is far different from the metropolitan Moscow and St. Petersburg. And to do so it worths to get some tips.</p></div></li><li><a href="/life/weird-moscow/">Weird Moscow</a><div><p>Last weekend I spent in Moscow. This was a short visit after 2 years since I left the city for Amsterdam. I had some
business to do but there was also time for walking round the city. It has been changed a lot. However I still think that
coming in there with someone without Soviet Union background would surprise them in many cases.</p>
<p>After I had came back to Helsinki I got a lot of questions like “How is it in Moscow?”. Ok, in this post I will try to
answer.</p></div></li><li><a href="/life/">My life</a><div></div></li></ul></div></div>

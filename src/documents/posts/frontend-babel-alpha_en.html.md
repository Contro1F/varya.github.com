Long ago I read and learned about web development only in Russian. Later, finishing English language course I became
to read more and more articles and blogs in English. The same went for conferences. I've started visiting
Russian-speaking conferences and later switched to English-speaking conferences in Europe. In both articles and conf
speaches I noticed how different the content is, depending on the language. Sometime I even thought that the communities
evolve differently and go different directions.
<excerpt/>
My Russian-speaking colleagues indeed know the "[HTML/CSS markup with ndeprendent blocks](http://vitaly.harisov.name/article/independent-blocks.html)"
article by Vitaly Harisov. He published
this in 2008 and so drew the main principles of HTML/CSS development today known as BEM. We can say that this was the
moment BEM started being developed in Russia and the neighbouring countries. As for English-speaking developers, they
learned about BEM only in 2012 from [my article in
SmashingMagazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/16/a-new-front-end-methodology-bem/). Then, as you might
know, [Harry Roberts](http://csswizardry.com/about/) caught sight
of that and thanks to his publications BEM became popular in the rest of the world.

Thus, 4 years passed since the technology was released until a common Alabama guy got a chance to learn about it. For
such along term many technologies could die.

No doubt, this is much better for both the technology and the industry if developers had have learned it in 2005. I
suppose that modular trend in the web would have started much earlier and we would have got the result faster. Today we
would use WebComponents (they implement some component ideas of BEM) everythere (and for a long time, already).

Some time ago I was thinking over these facts and so decided to dedicate some time and my blog pages to translations.
So the translated articles of [Ymaps modules](/en/issues/ym-modular-system) and
[BEML](/en/issues/beml-html-preprocessor) were published. I also had more articles in the queue for translation. Reading
a lot of developer blogs in Russian I realized how much interesting content is produced. But... "Is this in Russia
only?", I asked myself.

Imaging what a huge deal of new solutions, libraries and frameworks exist today all over the world! But you will never
learn them because their authors speak and publish Arabian, Spanish, Japanise and other languages which you do not know.
:-)

Nevertheless, we are living at awesome time. And we frontend developers have a wonderful community. Open source culture
and technologies like GitHub enable us to help each other and get perfect results together. And do not think that you
need to be a NodeJS committer to contribute. For example, in the same way many products get their documentation improved.

This encouraged me to run a website of collaborative translations from local languages into English.

The project is called **Frontend Babel** and this is its URL [http://frontendbabel.info](http://frontendbabel.info).
Technically it is a static generated blog (thanks to DocPad). Any person can take it and run their local copy, then add
a translated article and make a pull request into the original source.

* [About the project](frontendbabel.info/about/)
* [Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/frontendbabel/frontendbabel.github.com)
* [How to contribute](http://frontendbabel.info/how-to-contribute)

The first couple of articles is already translated by Max Shirshin. These are

* interesting [post about web page rendering by Alexander
  Skutin](frontendbabel.info/articles/webpage-rendering-101) (вы могли читать её на Хабре)
* and awesome [article about graphical interface by Danil
  Kovchy](frontendbabel.info/articles/graphical-interface).

You can already share these links to your English-speaking colleagues :-)

Max and I have plans to translate more next weeks. Also I hearten all of you who know Arabian, Japanise, Polish, French,
Spanish (and any other language) to join the project and translate. The English-speaking developers can do prove-reading.

Indeed this is a lot of hard work to translate into the foreign language. But I still would like to encourage you.
Having English-speaking guys in our community, we will get the texts improved. So, if you were thinking about writing in
English, this may be a good chance to start and learn.<br/>
Interesting articles will get traffic. With this, an author and a translator get benefits from being mentioned and new
proffesional contacts throught their websites and social networkds.

Always remember, your contribution into an open source project can be little but it is always invaluable! Here are just
some ideas on what you can do:

* [Add new source article into our task
  queue](https://github.com/frontendbabel/frontendbabel.github.com/issues/new)<br/>
If you know an interesting article worth to be published, create an issue about it. So another
contributer can grab this taks and translate it.
* [Push new translations](http://frontendbabel.info/how-to-contribute#push-new-translation)<br/>
Find a nice article in a language you know, translate it into English and publish at this website.
* **Tell friends about the project**<br/>
With mentioning this project in social networks and your blog posts you can involve people from
all over the world!
* Fix English in the texts<br/>
If you spotted a grammar error, you can edit an article (there is a link to editor below) and propose
your pull request.
* Propose site changes<br/>
Suggest what can be improved in this web site with adding your ideas in [the list of
issues](https://github.com/frontendbabel/frontendbabel.github.com/issues?labels=%40+Translation&state=open).
* [Grab an issue to do](https://github.com/frontendbabel/frontendbabel.github.com/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open)<br/>
With your concern this web site can be improved a lot :-)

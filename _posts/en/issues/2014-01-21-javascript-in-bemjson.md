We usually start developing a web site with prototyping the interface and then
implementing HTML/CSS and bacis JavaScript. In case
of using full BEM stack a tranformation from prototype to a functioning web
site goes smoothly. You can clone the project from
[project-stub](https://github.com/bem/project-stub) and create a static web page
as it was [described
earlier](http://bem.info/articles/start-with-project-stub/).

Thanks to `BEMHTML` templates you do not need write all the HTML manually.
Describing page sructure in `BEMJSON` rather than writing all the tags manually
saves time. But sometimes this is still a lot of work to do especially for large
pages.

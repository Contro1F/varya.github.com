styles for the pieces of an interface but also their JavaScript interactions and templates. As documentation, the style
guide should reflect them all. In other words, the components on the style guide’s pages should be the same living as in
production.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/react-angular-project/">Simple React Angular project</a><div><p>Earlier this year, I participated in a development of a single page application. With the team, we started this
project from scratch. This situation was the most suitable to practice the new technologies.</p>
<p>The stack I’ve tried was React + ES2015 + postcss + webpack. However, keeping in mind that most of the
team (who were supposed to maintain the project later) are mainly experienced in Angular, I was looking for some
sort of combination of these frameworks.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/react-hackathon-materials/">Materials for your React hackathon</a><div><p>Being a frontend developer these days means to learn the new things every day. We read articles and blog posts,
examine the changelogs, follow the Twitter announcements and participate in the GitHub discussions.
This helps to keep up.</p>
<p>However,
when it comes to something bigger, like the exploring of a new framework or an ecosystem, it is not enough.
The perfect solution is to organize a whole day hackathon for the developers in your company.
At SC5 online, we took this advantage mastering the React development. Few ecosystem components such as
webpack and redux came along.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/image-diffs-with-git/">Visual diffs for the images in a git repo</a><div><p>My first task for new projects is to create a git repository. Whether it is a new app, or conference slides, or even an
article, I prefer to keep everything in Git. It is an excellent tool, and, personally, I enjoy its command line
interface.</p>
<p>However, there is always room for improvement. Recently I found an idea how to make my git visualize the changes that
I’ve done to the images in a repository.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/dealing-atomically-with-icon-fonts/">Dealing atomically with icon fonts</a><div><p>My recent huge project was developing a library of CSS and JavaScript components for sharing this code across a lot of
web services and mobile apps. In most cases such work brings up question about how to avoid blocking the processes.</p>
<p>The library has its own flow, and obviously the new things can only appear in new versions. Although I made my best to
provide fast releases, and so the library has them 2-3 times a week, it is still understandable that the library
customers sometimes cannot wait even an hour.</p>
<p>I belive that one of the must-haves of UI library is the freedom which it should give to its customers. You can easily
provide this if practice atomic approach everythere. For example, for the icon fonts.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/pseudo-tag-cloud-css/">Tag cloud of random sizes in pure CSS</a><div><p>Last week I faced a need to make a fake tag cloud, where the words need to be of different size. This was needed for
a presentation slide, and as my slides are always in HTML/CSS, must be implemented with these technologies. It is always
possible to inject some JavaScript and code anything. But what about pure CSS, do we get random sizes there?</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/on-the-unicorn-law/">An answer to the question which should not have been asked</a><div><p>I never thought that I would write a post about diversity. But as the <strong>unicorn law</strong> says that being a woman in tech you
will be eventually speaking about women in tech, I do so now. However I’m doing this not because it is a strong will of
mine. Something happened which makes me to respond.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/sc5-styleguide-for-smallers/">Style-guide the smaller things</a><div><p>I’ve been presenting <a href="http://styleguide.sc5.io/">SC5 Style Guide</a> several times during this year sharing my experience of using it for one
of the SC5’s clients, Elisa. Assuming that Elisa is a huge mobile operator with a lot of websites and a need
to keep those websites visually consistent, there is no wonder that the SC5 Style Guide as a tool provides benefits
there. But what about smaller websites? Would it be useful there? I did not know the answer to this question
and wanted to experiment. The experiment was conducted on my blog codebase.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/jscs-in-use/">JSCS in use</a><div><p>This time I would like to share my experience of keeping a codestyle in one of my working projects. This is about a new
tool called <strong>JSCS</strong> which we have recently chosen with the team and now are very pleased with the result.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/run-app-in-time-on-mac/">Run on time (about Mac applications)</a><div><p>I use the same laptop for both work and personal needs. This is useful but makes me see to keeping my
work-life balance. I do this simply — turn off all the applications running when I finish my working day
in the evening. The only issue is not to forget to open them again next day. But this process can be automatized. :-)</p>
<p></p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/frontend-babel-alpha/">The so different frontend community and how we deal with it</a><div><p>Long time ago I could read and learn about web development in Russian only. Later, having completed an English language course, I began to read articles and blogs in English more and more. The same went for conferences: I visited
Russian-speaking conferences at first and later switched to English-speaking conferences in Europe. In both articles and conference talks, I noticed how the content was different depending on the language used. Sometime I even thought that the communities evolve in different ways and follow different directions.</p>
<p></p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/steroids-drawers/">Using side drawers in mobile apps on Steroids.js</a><div><p>As a mobile apps user you may be already familiar to drawers.
They are quite popular solution for a side menu. Using <code>Steroids</code>
HTML5/JavaScript framework for hybrid mobile applications, you
can bring such an interface solution into your product very easy.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/docpad-with-bem-taste/">Docpad with the taste of BEM</a><div><p>Let me present a stub for <strong>docpad-run</strong> project with
<strong>bem-built</strong> static assets. If you ever wanted to be
a generic blog holder equiped with nice and neat static
files, here we go.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/html5-mobile-app-width-native-ui/">HTML5 mobile apps with native UI on Steroids</a><div><p>Recently I attended <a href="http://2014.front-trends.com/">Front Trends 2014</a> in Warsaw.
This is an awesome conference which you should (no, definitely have to!) attend
in 2015. Besides incredible main programm Front Trends provides a set of Lighting Talks.
This year I was a part of it presenting <a href="http://www.appgyver.com/steroids">Steroids</a>,
a framework and a toolkit for developing HTML5 mobile apps. If you did not have
a chance to hear it, this offline text presentation is for you</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/switching-to-bem-core-2/">Switching to bem-core#v2</a><div><p>The <code>bem-core</code> library goes futher and there already is <code>2.0.0</code> version
available. This blog was safely switched to the new major version with
<a href="https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/commit/f21f810b7cb4e16206ef3d088a8b2c38b615f8f3">some diff to the
code</a>.
Now so can do you. Careful examination of the version changelog will help you
with it. Look how I did this</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/beml-html-preprocessor/">BEML - an HTML preprocessor for BEM</a><div><p>Depending on a project people prefer different ways to adapt BEM.
This results
into a range of tools for our choice. Today, I am translating Maxim Shkalin’s
description of the <code>BEML</code> templating pre-processor.</p>
<p>Willing to lighten the development with BEM I propose a tiny extension for the
HTML syntax (yes, I used to writ all those long CSS classes manually). As the
name <code>BEMHTML</code> is greedily taken by the Yandex guys, let us call it <code>BEML</code></p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/borschik-static-assets/">Borschik helps with remote static assets</a><div><p>Last week I met the need to develop a web site which static assets have to be
hosted on a different server and respond by different URLs than its HTML. This
is the requirement to all the static files: stylesheets and JavaScript linked to
the page as well as imges and fonts mentioned in HTML, CSS and JavaScript
code</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/ym-modular-system/">YM Modular System. Why?</a><div><p>The recently published <a href="http://bem.info/tutorials/articles/bem-js-tutorial/">step-by-step tutorial on
i-bem.js</a> mentioned <strong>YM
modular system</strong> as a base for component JavaScript solution behind BEM. Why do
we need another modular system? Let us see…</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/javascript-in-bemjson/">JavaScript in BEMJSON</a><div><p>We usually start developing a web site prototyping the interface and then
implementing HTML/CSS and bacis JavaScript. In case
of using the full BEM stack a tranformation from prototype to a functioning web
site goes smoothly. You can clone the project from
<a href="https://github.com/bem/project-stub">project-stub</a> and create a static web page
as it was <a href="http://bem.info/articles/start-with-project-stub/">described
earlier</a>.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/blocks-and-bundles/">Blocks are bricks, and bundles are buildings</a><div><p>A couple of days ago I was asked about some basic things of using <a href="https://github.com/bem/project-stub/tree/14e24fd17ba66a357a2f6fcdce045065b4eb5d6c">BEM project
stub</a>
from someone who is enjoying the full BEM stack (BEM-CSS, i-bem.js and BEMHTML
templates) for their projects. Answering the questions I promised to turn the
information into text as we always skip many important things mistakenly
considering them being primitive.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/fonts-no-cramp/">Custom fonts with no cramp</a><div><p>A developer using custom fonts in web (don’t say this is evil) usually face a
dilemma.</p>
<p>The users’ main interest is the content of the page not the
view. It is nice to provide it as fast as possible and then apply a custom font.
This blog used to work this way. I provided a script among others in the bundle
linked by the end of the page.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/best-way-to-hide/">The Best Way to Hide</a><div><p>There is a well-known front-end pattern which is to have hidden elements in DOM
and make them visible when necessary. As with any good pattern, it can be
compromised by wrong implementation.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/javascript-component-solutions/">JavaScript components low basics</a><div><p>This article features common problems that developers often face, or maybe used
to face before the current open source era, when writing JavaScript for the
client side; showcase of possible solutions to these problems and explanations
of my choices.</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/patterned-triangle/">Patterned triangles with  CSS</a><div><p>As you might know, I recently run the <a href="https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love">BEM
LOVE</a> project to demonstrate how blocks
can communicate with JavaScript</p></div></li><li><a href="/posts/">Tech Blog</a><div></div></li><li><a href="//">About me</a><div><p>I am a front-end developer originally from the Utmost North
(<a href="http://maps.yandex.com/-/CVR3nIPf">Petrozavodsk</a>,
Karelia); currently living in Helsinki
and working for <a href="http://sc5.io">SC5 Online</a>.<br/>
Before, I had been living Amsterdam for less than a year and previously in
<a href="http://images.yandex.com/yandsearch?text=Moscow">Moscow</a>, Russia for 5 years
and working for
<a href="http://www.yandex.com/">Yandex</a>.<br/>
According to official papers, my name is <code>Varvara Stepanova</code>, although most people just call me <code>Varya</code>.</p>
<p>More than 4 years I am a member of
the <a href="http://bem.info/">BEM</a> team.
Our mission is to open source the full technological stack that powers the Yandex UI framework.
Being a remote BEM developer I use the solutions in my current work and personal
projects.</p>
<p>Besides the actual development of components, libraries and tools, I frequently speak at tech
conferences, usually explaining the BEM methodology. I write articles in English and Russian, as well as
tutorials and training projects to help developers perform their first dive into
BEM.
There are some links on the <a href="en/content/">content</a> page for your browsing pleasure.</p>
<p>I am keen on traveling and dream of having friends all over the world.
If you’re interested, here’s the first personal thing to learn about me: I am passionate about cats, all of them (lions included).</p>
<p>On this site I publish my day-to-day writings as well as links to
articles, projects and presentations.</p>
<p>This site is available in both English and <a href="/ru">Russian</a>.</p>

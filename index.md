I am a front-end developer originally from the Utmost North (Petrozavodsk,
Karelia); currently living in Moscow, Russia and working for
[Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/).

I has been working with [BEM](http://bem.info/) team for almost 4 years. BEM is
a project of pushing a full stack of technologies behind Yandex in-house UI framework into open
source.<br/>
Besides developing BEM technologies, libraries and tools, I am a frequent
speaker on BEM at local and international conferences. Also I write articles,
tutorials and training projects to help developers with understanding and diving
into BEM. You can find it all on the [content](en/content/) page.

I am keen on traveling and dream to have friends all over the world. The last
important thing you should know — I am passionate about cats, all of them, no
matter lion or kitten.

This site is available in both English and [Russian](/ru).

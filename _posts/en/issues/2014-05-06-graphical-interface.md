My colleague and a great proffesional [Danil
Kovchiy](https://twitter.com/kovchiy) came up with an aricle about Graphical
interface summing up his experince in interface design for
[Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/). Those who read in Russian can enjoy [the
original article](https://medium.com/p/70bb2d0d58be). For the others, I
translated into English.<excerpt/>

An introduction first. I am an interface designer for
[Yandex](http://www.yandex.com/). I have been working here on
[Yandex.Maps](http://maps.yandex.com/?text=Russian%20Federation%2C%20Moscow&sll=37.619899%2C55.753676&ll=37.619899%2C55.753676&spn=1.505127%2C0.542907&z=10&l=map),
[Search results
page](http://beta.yandex.ru/yandsearch?lr=213&banerid=123&text=design), icons,
promo content, documentation, common portal interface components and a design
prototyping toolkit. Besides, I was watching over y colleagues developing
[Yandex Main Page](http://beta.yandex.ru/),
[Market service](http://market.yandex.ru/?clid=505),
[News agregator](http://news.yandex.ru/), [Image
search](http://beta.yandex.ru/images/), [Video
search](http://beta.yandex.ru/video/search?text=michael%20jackson&safety=1),
[Disk cloud storage](https://disk.yandex.ru/client/disk),
[Yandex.Auto](http://auto.yandex.ru/) and [Realty
page](http://realty.yandex.ru/).

During this process I made a few discoveries and drew some conclusions. This
experince has been checked with high numbers, thus I would like to share the
findings with you. This are the points I am going to cosider:

1. Does an interface designer have to be able to draw and master the fonts?
1. Is the text representation a separate professional area?
1. Is it needed to program and create HTML/CSS markup?
1. How to review an interface?

And before we dive, refresh your memory with a cople of terms:

An `interface` is a model of interaction with product.
A `designer` is someone who defines an interface type and its content.

These are the examples of interface types:

* graphical interface;
* programmatic interface;
* comand line interface;
* voice interface.

Apparently, I will be describing graphical interface.

To put it differently, in my opinion an interface is not a set of buttons; and a
designer is not opposite to a developer.

Another thing, I have not read a lot of books about it and was not trained to do
it. I started to work with it 2 years before graduation from a technical
univercity and so earned my living. Thus my experince results from practice and
observation.

## Form
Being a child I thought that with drawing I projected an image in my head onto a
piece of paper. When I began to copy comics characters or real objects, drawing
turned into a skill to notice object details.

First, I valued the form. As for respect to the color, it came to me much later.
